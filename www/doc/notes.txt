Preserved the database qal_ prefix, because q-control nomenclature already uses qal_contact.
Much like the other api prefixes, where procedures originally defined in one package were moved to another,
because they have usefulness beyond the original package's scope.
Except here, the prefix keeps the existing usage and keeps the package associated with its primary purpose:
to serve as contact manager for the accounts-ledger package.
