# 1. Identify the lib/templates to add to the complement .adp page
#    that determine the overall presenation structure.

# 2. Define the form as a list to list.
#    Each list item represents an HTML form element.
#    Value of 'context' becomes a variable that gets passed
#    to the templates in the complement .adp page.
#    Only requires the name/value pairs of 'name', 'context', 'datatype'.
#    Datatype comes from q-data-types, which provides defaults for all
#    values.
#    Any additional attributes overwrite the defaults provided by datatype.
#    Best practices:  include a label and title, and use internationalization
#    keys if possible.
#    To add html before an element, add name/value attribute 'html_before'.
#    To add html after an element, add name/value attribute 'html_after'.
#    Put the definition of the list of lists into a proc,
#     and keep it with package_name-defaults.tcl, where other field
#     values are kept.. so the M part of C of MVC is all in one place.
#     The M part of MVC is the sql defintions sql/*/package_name-create.sql
